## Situation

With the Russian invasion of Ukraine continuing and political and military stability in Russia continuing to worsen, it has been decided to bolster military forces across Europe.
NATO has established 4 EFP battlegroups in Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania in response to the invasion.
This brings the total of NATO battlegroups to eight including the original 4 in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.

However this still leaves Georgia vulnerable and, as such, the Georgian government has requested assistance.
NATO has denied the request for a NATO battlegroup in Georgia due to the lack of their NATO member status.

The Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) has dispatched its own UK-led EFP battlegroup to Georgia (EFP-Golf).
JSW has been given the central role in this deployment making up a majority of the battlegroupâ€™s airpower.

The UK is keen to help Georgia in this issue and has spoken to the heads of state of other JEF nations.
As the JEF is not a NATO organisation it is in the position to assist Georgia.
It further has the capabilities of Sweden and Finland at its disposal, countries that have either not officially joined NATO or are in the process of doing so.
This support signals thier willingness to defend like-minded nations.

## Commander's Intent

The role of JSW in the region will be to conduct training sorties to show commitment and the capability to ensure stability in the region and be on alert for additional tasking in support of allied operations.

## Mission

### Primary

Conduct training flights to improve required skill sets in support of EFP-Golf.

### Secondary

Conduct patrols and reconnaissance flights along the Georgian borders with South Ossetia, Abkhazia & Russian.

## ROE

Return fire only, limited to immediate threat and group.

## LOE

Remain within Georgian or International airspace at all times.
