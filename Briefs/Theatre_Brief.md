## Situation

With the Russian invasion of Ukraine continuing and political and military stability in Russian continuing to worsen it has been decided to bolster military forces across Europe.
NATO has established a further 4 EFP battlegroups in Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania in response to the invasion.
This brings the total to 8 NATO battlegroups including the original 4 in Estonia, Latvia,  Lithuania and Poland.

However this still leaves Georgia vulnerable and as such the Georgian government has requested assistants.
However NATO has denied the request for a NATO battlegroup in Georgia as they are not a NATO member.

The Joint Expeditionary force has dispatched its own EFP battlegroup to Georgia (EFP-Golf)with the UK taking the lead.
JSW has been given the centre role in this deployment making up a majority of the battlegroupâ€™s airpower.

The UK is keen to help Georgia in this issue and has spoken to the heads of state of other Joint Expeditionary force (JEF) nations.
As the JEF is not a NATO organisation it is in the position to assist Georgia.
It further has the capabilities of Sweden and Finland at its disposal, 2 countries that have no officially joined NATO as of yet but are very willing to display their willingness to defend likeminded nations.

## Commander's Intent

The role of JSW in the region will be to conduct training sorties to show commitment and the capability to ensure stability in the region and be on alert for additional tasking in support of allied operations.

## Mission

### Primary

Conduct training flights to improve required skill sets in support of EFP-Golf.

### Secondary

Conduct patrols and reconnaissance flights along the Georgian borders with South Ossetia, Abkhazia & Russian.

## ROE

Return fire only, limited to immediate threat and group.

## LOE

Remain within Georgian or International airspace at all times.
