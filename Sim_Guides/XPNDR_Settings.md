# Setting Transponders for LotATC Integration

## Introduction

Op RAMPART is setup to provide a realistic insight into combined civil and military aviation in a complex airspace environment.
When controllers assist JEF pilots using LotATC, they will only see primary radar returns and transponder codes for each aircraft on the server.
Some aircraft, such as airliners and tankers, who are flying on IFR flight plans, have been pre-assigned a transponder code and the LotATC server is kept up to date with the details of each flight plan.
For example, Israir 833 is operating under the flight number 6H 883 from Tel Aviv to Batumi.
It has been pre-assigned the transponder code 7223 which is reflected on the server, therfore LotATC recognises the code and populates the details as shown below:
