# Standard Operating Procedures for 801 NAS

## Introduction

801 NAS is deployed as an element of the Joint Expeditionary Force for Op RAMPART in the Georgian area.
The squadron will be based out of the Tbilisi-Lochini (UGTB) airfield for the short-term until such time the squadron may need to move to an unimproved site.

While at UGTB, we are expected to integrate with, and operate alongside, a large number of different aircraft types and nationalities.
Squadron pilots will need to maintain good situational awareness in the airfield vicinity to operate safely.

Where possible aircraft movements should be conducted as flights to reduce workload on controllers and other pilots.

Refer to you pre-prepared kneeboards for the latest information.

## Airfield Procedures

### Start-Up and Taxi

In addition to normal NATOPs procedures, 801 NAS pilots will comply with the following procedures during start up and Taxi:

- BATT to ON
- Radios to ON
- COMM 1 to Ground
- COMM 2 to ATIS then Interflight
- Check-in on COMM 1 and COMM2
- Request start on Ground
- ANTI COL to ON

Continue with normal start up procedures, remembering to set trim pitch to -4 and noting VREST information.

When ready to taxi:

- APRCH light to ON
- Remove chocks
- Request taxi and, if applicable, obtain clearance
- Taxi forward 3-4'

Once all flight elements are ready, continue to taxi.
Note that if carrying any live ordinance, including gun ammunition, taxiing through civil terminals is to be avoided.

### Takeoff

When cleared for take-off, line up on the runway as briefed.
Each aircraft shall be position forward enough that their intakes are in line with, and no further behind, the adjacent aircraft's hot pipes.

- Parking brakes set
- Pitch trim set to -2
- Aircraft configured per VREST
- Five finger checks:
  - ENG page selected and ACCEL boxed
  - RPM to 60-70%
  - Note ACCEL times in limits
  - Nozzles to stop, check duct pressure
  - Nozzles to 0
  - Water to STO, note RPM change
  - As required, water to STO or OFF
  - As required, FLAPS to AUTO or STOVL
- Starting from lead element wipe controls full deflection
- Other aircraft in turn wipe controls
- When last element has wiped controls, lead will roll

### Departures

Flight from UGTB should be done either under VFR departure rules or by following an approved IFR departure plate.
In most cases, if departing to the Tsalka MOA and R6909 range, use of the LAGAS ONE(1) departure will be preferred.
For all other departures to the west, it's likely that the MUKHRANI TWO(2) departure to join the B-143 airway will be preferred.

If departing under VFR conditions, be cautious of rotary traffic departing to the north and to the west.
Standard rotary low-level routes have been assigned for helicopters as shown below.

### Approaches

A series of IFR approach charts are available for use in the pilot kneeboards.
If in IFR conditions, pilots will need to use either the ILS or TACAN approaches to a full stop, or, only if specifically cleared by ATC, may request to cancel IFR when below base and back in VFR conditions.

For pilots who are less comfortable with IFR approaches, you may request vectors to VFR conditions for a visual recovery.

### Landing

By default, 801 NAS pilots will follow the procedure for a Fixed Nozzle Slow Landing (FNSL) if arriving on the main runway at UGTB.
All patterns will be joined at 800' AGL and 350s as normal.
The detailed procedure for a FNSL is found at A1-AV8BB-NFM-000, section 7.6.5.1.1., however a quick reference image is below as an aide-memoire.

## Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP)

To assist with the maintenance of currency and competency of the low-speed STOVL handling characteristics of the Harrier, a FCLP site (also referred to as the "Ski-Ramp" or simply "Ramp") has been built on taxiway November of UGTB.
The Ski-Ramp may be used at any time by 801NAS pilots as an alternate means of takeoff or landing at UGTB subject to ATC clearance.

The procedure for the Ski-Ramp will always be in accordance with NAVAIR 00-80T-111.
An extract of the relevant day pattern procedure is included below for reference.

## Austere Strips

801NAS pilots are approved to conduct Vertical Landings (VLs) and Short Takeoffs (STOs) from predefined austere strips or from taxiway November at UGTB.
The procedures to be followed in these conditions are found in A1-AV8BB-NFM-000.
When operating at density altitudes above sea level, it is imperative that the max dry and max wet takeoff and landing weights are calculated as applicable and not exceeded at any time.
A reference graphic for the approach to a VL is shown below.
