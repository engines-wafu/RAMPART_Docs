# Tbilisi Area Flying Order Book

## Introduction

These Flying Order Book (FOB) is intended to provide flying orders for the Joint Strike Wing consisting of: 801NAS, 11Sqn, 4Sqn, and 656AAC.
Individual squadron Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) may be produced for the operation of a specific aircraft type by the applicable Commanding Officers of these squadrons.

## General Procedures

### Applicability

These orders apply to all UK military air operations in the Tbilisi (UGTB) Air Traffic Zones and, where appropriate, through the greater Georgian airspace.
Nothing in these orders absolves aircrew of their responsibilities for safe aviations and, as such, pilots may deviate from these procedures where necessary based on their assessment to maintain risks to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP).

### Currency

Commanding Officers must ensure their pilots are suitable current, competent, and qualified to undertake their assigned duties.
As such, individual pilots SHALL maintain their own currency log to ensure they have completed at least three of the following evolutions in a rolling 90-day window:

- Day landings,
- Night landings,
- Instrument departures,
- Instrument approaches,
- Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR),
- Night Air-to-Air Refueling (NAAR),
- Day Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP)\*, and
- Night FCLP\*.

\* for rotary wing and STOVL aircraft only.

### Take Off

#### Single-ship

#### Multi-ship

### Circuit Practice

*How do we break this down a bit more?
At UGTB We have rotaries on 31H/13H, I spoke with Houseman suggest keeping them on an easterly, 500' circuit with a base turn that keeps them north of apron 3.
The [Harrier SOPs](801NAS.md) are already drafted and keep with the standard STOVL procedures for regular circuits at 800'.
We also have the FCLP and ramp on the north end of taxiway November.
The FCLP will always be a west-side, left-hand pattern, and we can keep the patterns on the runway to be west-side only, too.
I think we can still keep a standard 1,500'(?) fast-jet pattern for the non-nozzly folk without any conflict.*

*Also remember we have Draken, LLC. at Solangug, too.*

### Arrivals and Departures

*We have a set of instrument and arrival charts in the mission file kneeboards, but I think we can specify, for example, that IFR traffic to the Tsalka MOA/R-6909 range should use the UGTB LAGAS ONE departure, and traffic to the west (i.e. Poti MOA, tankers, Batumi) should use the MUKRHANI TWO departure.*

*VFR procedures would just need to deconflict as necessary.*

### Formations

*So we need to update any of this based on IV Sqns training?
There's a lot in the old FOBs that is really useful information, are we better breaking that out into a dedicated formation SOP handbook that's easier to reference?*

## Range Activity

There are several active ranges in theatre including the Tsalka MOA and R-6909 ranges, the Poti MOA BFM range, and the Samegrelo MOA low-level range.
Refer to the relevant [range brief](../Briefs/Range_Brief.md) for specific procedures.
